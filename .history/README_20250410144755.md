## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file based on the example provided, with your own Stability AI API key and Solana settings.

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing Payments Functionality

The application is configured to use real Solana payments on the mainnet. Follow these steps to test payment functionality:

### 1. Set Up a Phantom Wallet

- Install the [Phantom wallet extension](https://phantom.app/) for your browser
- Create a new wallet or import an existing one
- Switch to Solana Mainnet:
  - Open Phantom wallet
  - Click the gear icon (Settings)
  - Select "Change Network"
  - Select "Mainnet Beta"

### 2. Ensure You Have SOL for Real Transactions

- To use the application on mainnet, you need to have actual SOL in your wallet
- The application charges 0.001 SOL per image generation
- Make sure your wallet has at least 0.005 SOL to cover multiple generations and transaction fees

### 3. Test the Payment Process

- Connect your Phantom wallet to PennyPics
- Enter a prompt and configure your image settings
- Click "Pay & Generate"
- Phantom will ask you to approve the transaction for 0.001 SOL
- After approval, the payment will be processed and the image will be generated
- You can verify the transaction on the Solana Explorer link provided

### 4. Verify Transaction

- After a successful payment, a transaction link will appear
- Click on the link to see the transaction details on Solana Explorer
- Verify that the payment was sent to the specified recipient address: `4FNJbnrwrmRY4W5TPRCv579iypQzh69pPmH1QM5M5oqB`

### 5. Switch to Development Mode

To disable real payments during further development, change in `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_PAYMENT=true
```

You can also switch back to devnet if needed:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

## Environment Variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL`: URL for Solana RPC (use devnet for testing)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_PAYMENT`: Set to "true" to skip payments, "false" to enable real payments
- `STABILITY_API_KEY`: Your Stability AI API key
