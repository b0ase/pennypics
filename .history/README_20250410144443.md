## Testing Payments Functionality

The application is now configured to use real Solana payments on the devnet. Follow these steps to test payment functionality:

### 1. Set Up a Phantom Wallet

- Install the [Phantom wallet extension](https://phantom.app/) for your browser
- Create a new wallet or import an existing one
- Switch to Solana Devnet:
  - Open Phantom wallet
  - Click the gear icon (Settings)
  - Select "Developer Settings"
  - Under "Network," select "Devnet"

### 2. Get Devnet SOL for Testing

- Visit a Solana Faucet to receive free devnet SOL:
  - Go to https://solfaucet.com/
  - Enter your wallet address (you can copy it from Phantom)
  - Select "Devnet" and request a small amount of SOL
  - Or use other faucets: https://faucet.solana.com/ or https://faucet.quicknode.com/solana/devnet

### 3. Test the Payment Process

- Connect your Phantom wallet to PennyPics
- Enter a prompt and configure your image settings
- Click "Pay & Generate"
- Phantom will ask you to approve the transaction for 0.001 SOL
- After approval, the payment will be processed and the image will be generated
- You can verify the transaction on the Solana Explorer link provided

### 4. Verify Transaction

- After a successful payment, a transaction link will appear
- Click on the link to see the transaction details on Solana Explorer
- Verify that the payment was sent to the specified recipient address: `4FNJbnrwrmRY4W5TPRCv579iypQzh69pPmH1QM5M5oqB`

### 5. Switch Back to Development Mode

To disable real payments during further development, change in `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_PAYMENT=true
```
